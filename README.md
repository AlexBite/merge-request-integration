Merge Request Integration is a plugin which helps you to do Code Review right in your IDE.

What you can do:

- Check pipeline status and approval status.
- Do code review, navigate code with Diff View right in your IDE.
- Add and reply a comment
- Approve/revoke your approval
- More and more features will be coming soon :)

Currently the plugin supports GitLab only (gitlab cloud and self-hosted).
